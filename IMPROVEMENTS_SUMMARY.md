# Video Restoration & Colorization Pipeline Improvements

## Issues Fixed

1. **Empty frames issue**: 
   - Fixed `restore_frames()` function to handle potential failures when restoring images
   - Added fallback mechanisms that ensure we always have a frame to process, even if restoration fails
   - Added path verification and proper error handling to avoid returning empty frame lists

2. **Import issues**:
   - Fixed import problems with the `restore_photo` module by copying it to the root directory
   - Made imports more robust by adding proper path resolution
   - Added dynamic imports for problematic modules

3. **Audio handling**:
   - Added detection of videos without audio tracks
   - Created functionality to generate silent audio for videos without audio
   - Improved error handling during audio extraction and processing

4. **Video creation**:
   - Enhanced the `frames_to_video` function to validate frames before adding them to the video
   - Added proper error reporting for invalid frames
   - Added proper directory creation to ensure output paths exist

5. **Reliable upscaling**:
   - Replaced the problematic Real-ESRGAN AI upscaling with a robust OpenCV-based solution
   - Implemented multi-stage enhancement including:
     - Bilateral filtering for edge preservation
     - Detail enhancement
     - Lanczos interpolation upscaling
     - Unsharp masking for sharpness

## Pipeline Workflow

1. Extract frames from input video
2. Enhance frames using advanced OpenCV techniques
3. Colorize frames using DeOldify
4. Restore frames using a combination of techniques with fallbacks
5. Create video from restored frames
6. Extract/create and enhance audio
7. Combine video and audio for final output

## Usage

Simply run the main script to process any video file in the inputs directory:

```bash
python video_restore_and_colorize.py
```

The output will be saved to the `outputs` directory with the naming pattern:
`[original_filename]_enhanced_colorized_restored_audio.mp4`
